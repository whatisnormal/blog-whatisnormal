<p>
  You have created a project with the shiny new  Angular V15 (Who does not want standalone components right?)..but wait a minute? where are the environments configs?
   If you are in v15, bad luck as you will need to create the environment folders and what is necessary in angular.json manually.
   Still, the angular team created a branch new schematic in v.15.1 that solves the gap. Just run:
   <pre>ng g environments</pre>
